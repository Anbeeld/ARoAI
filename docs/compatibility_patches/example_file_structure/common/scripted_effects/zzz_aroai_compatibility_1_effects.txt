aroai_evaluate_building_synthetic_oil_plants = { # Paste building key in the name
    aroai_evaluate_production_building = {
        id = $id$ # Don't change, just copy
        crucial = $crucial$ # Don't change, just copy
        good = mg:oil # Good that we'll judge this building by, usually the one produced by it
        weight = aroai_industry_weight_1 # How important is it to build this building for this resource
        offset = 0 # Values over 0 mean higher than usual productivity will be required for this good in this building
    }
}

# Notes:
#
# Prefix in weight ("industry_") is determined by building, not by good. Even though oil is usually a resource good,
# the building is industry so you are required to use industry prefix here. Even if it was grain you must use industry.
# 
# Most primary goods have weight from 1 to 5, check /src/common/scripted_effects/aroai_static_data_effects.txt for more
# examples. Offset is rarely used, but it's important for byproducts and substitution, if you'll dive deep into it.
# 
# You can evaluate a building by multiple goods simply by performing the effect multiple times, e.g.:
# aroai_evaluate_building_whaling_station = {
#     aroai_evaluate_production_building = {
#         id = $id$
#         crucial = $crucial$
#         good = mg:oil
#         weight = aroai_resource_weight_1
#         offset = 0
#     }
#     aroai_evaluate_production_building = {
#         id = $id$
#         crucial = $crucial$
#         good = mg:meat
#         weight = aroai_resource_weight_10
#         offset = 6
#     }
# }
# Both weight and offset are high for meat here, meaning it's much less important than oil when we evaluate whaling
# station, as it's basically a byproduct in terms of building economy and what affects if it's productive or not.
# 
# However, you are free to set any amount of goods with various weights and offsets, e.g. two or more equal or similarly
# important goods. Usually this is done with checking if buildings in the country use required production methods, as in
# aroai_evaluate_building_logging_camp in /src/common/scripted_effects/aroai_static_data_effects.txt, but compatibility
# patches do not support this. Instead do it in a straight way, for example how it's done for vanilla livestock ranch:
# aroai_evaluate_building_livestock_ranch = {
#     aroai_evaluate_production_building = {
#         id = $id$
#         crucial = $crucial$
#         good = mg:fabric
#         weight = aroai_agriculture_weight_1
#         offset = 0
#     }
#     aroai_evaluate_production_building = {
#         id = $id$
#         crucial = $crucial$
#         good = mg:meat
#         weight = aroai_agriculture_weight_4
#         offset = 0
#     }
# }
