### Description

**Anbeeld's Revision of AI** aka **ARoAI** is a mod that focuses on making the AI in Victoria 3 as good as possible at developing economy and infrastructure of the countries controlled by it.

Vanilla algorithm of constructing buildings and managing budget is **disabled** in favor of more efficient fully custom scripts, which leads to AI countries being noticeably stronger, including higher **GDP and SoL**. The same scripts are used to provide players with the **Autobuild** feature that you can enable in the decision tab.
